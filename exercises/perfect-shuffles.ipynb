    "A perfect shuffle is when the cards during a shuffle alternate perfectly: one from the left hand, one from the right hand, one from the left hand, and so on. Only a magician can perform a perfect shuffle, it requires such slight of hand. And only a mathematician can wonder what are the properties of a perfect shuffle? Does it, for instance, return the deck back to the original order after a certain, perhaps small, number of shuffles\n",
    "\n",
    "The question was considered by someone who is both a mathematician and a magicina, Persi Diaconns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise in slices, we will simulate a perfect shuffle and answer the question of how many perfect shuffles return the deck to the original order. The trick to the problem is to work backwards. Rather than considering a shuffle, simulate the un-shuffle, which would alternately take cards backwards from the finished shuffle, and stack the two halves and a backward cut.\n"
